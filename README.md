# Reflection
I have coded a little bit in unity before so this wasnt all brand new. However i did learn some new helpful things like how to make my camera update everyframe smoother with LateUpdate and other small techniques like that. Overall this was a fun and short unity tutorial i think would help anyone get a jump at coding and scripting.
